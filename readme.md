# Mastery

A three-way (the newest version of two branches and the version exactly before branching) Abstract Syntax Tree structured merge tool.

## Getting Started

GG! I don't know how to use you!

## Road Map

- [ ] Parse from source file
- [ ] Formater of output
    - [ ] Format of conflict
- [ ] More heuristics
- [ ] Some refinement of syntax
- [ ] Improved algorithm
  - [ ] More efficient identification algorithm
  - [ ] RTED
- [ ] More reasonable implementation of matching to keep the magic order
- [ ] Graphic AST mapping for debug
    - @namasikanam: looks very hard
- [ ] Json dumping from the AST
- [ ] Delete unreasonable `Nothing` design
- [ ] Auto check with expected result
